# Decoder-Ring

## Project objectives
Built functions for an application with three ciphers: 
- Caesar Shift
- Polybius Square
- Substitution Cipher

This project tested my ability to build tricky algorithms as well as write unit tests with Mocha and Chai.

## Project setup
Download files to your computer and `cd` into the folder.

Then, install dependencies locally by running the command:
```
npm i
```

To run the tests, you can run the following command:
```
npm test
```

To watch how the code you write affects the application website, you can run the following command. This command will start a server and take over your terminal window. To stop the server from running, you can press Control+C.

```
npm start
```
